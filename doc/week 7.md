# Week 7: Offline Mode & Notifications Setup (Ongoing)

## Objective
Implement offline access and push notification features to enhance usability and user engagement.

## Summary
In Week 7, development focused on enabling offline functionality within the **CultureAI** application. Local data storage was implemented using **SQLite** to cache monument details, images, and user session data, allowing users to access content without an active internet connection. In parallel, **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** was configured to support push notifications related to cultural events and nearby monuments. This phase is currently ongoing and will be further refined in the next stage.

## Key Activities
- Configured SQLite database for offline data caching  
- Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications  
- Designed local database schema and synchronization logic with Firebase  

## Outcomes
- Offline mode partially implemented with local caching support  
- Push notification system configured and ready for deployment
