# Week 7: Offline Mode & Notifications Setup (Ongoing)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement offline functionality and push notifications for better user engagement.

## 📘 Summary
In Week 7, we began working on offline functionality by implementing an SQLite database to cache monument data, images, and user session information. This allows users to access content even when they are not connected to the internet. Additionally, we set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications about cultural events and nearby monuments.

## 📌 Key Activities
- Set up SQLite database for offline data caching.
- Integrated push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- Designed schema to store monument data locally and sync with Firebase.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Offline mode partially implemented with local data caching.
- Push notification feature is ready for future deployment.
