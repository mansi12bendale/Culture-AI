# Week 3: Dynamic Data Integration

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Objective
Integrate dynamic monument data into the application for real-time content rendering.

## Summary
In Week 3, the focus was on integrating dynamic data into the **CultureAI** application using a Web-to-Android development approach. Monument datasets were parsed to extract essential information such as names, descriptions, and image paths. This data was dynamically rendered on the home screen using web-based components. Efficient image loading techniques were applied to ensure smooth performance and improved user experience.

## Key Activities
- Parsed monument dataset to extract names, descriptions, and image references  
- Implemented dynamic data rendering for monument listings  
- Optimized image loading for better performance  
- Created structured data models to manage monument information  

## Outcomes
- Monument data successfully rendered dynamically in the application  
- Images load efficiently without performance issues  
- Application now supports scalable, data-driven content
=======
