# Week 4: Google Maps Integration & Geolocation

## 🎯 Objective
Display monument locations on Google Maps using geographical data.

## 📘 Summary
In Week 4, we integrated Google Maps to plot monuments based on their latitude and longitude. After obtaining the necessary API keys, we used the coordinates from the dataset to add markers on the map. Each marker is linked to the monument’s detail page, offering users a seamless navigation experience.

## 📌 Key Activities
- Integrated Google Maps API and obtained API key.
- Parsed latitude and longitude from the dataset for geolocation.
- Plotted monument markers on the map.
- Linked map markers to detailed monument pages.

## ✅ Outcomes
- Google Maps functionality is implemented.
