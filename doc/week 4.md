# Week 4: Google Maps API Integration

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Objective
Integrate Google Maps into the application to display monument locations using geographical data.

## Summary
During Week 4, Google Maps functionality was integrated into the **CultureAI** application using a Web-to-Android approach. After configuring the required Google Maps API key, monument location data containing latitude and longitude values was parsed from the dataset. Interactive map markers were plotted for each monument, allowing users to explore cultural sites visually. Each marker was linked to its corresponding monument detail page, enabling smooth and intuitive navigation.

## Key Activities
- Integrated Google Maps API and configured API key  
- Extracted latitude and longitude values from the dataset  
- Plotted interactive monument markers on Google Maps  
- Linked map markers to respective monument detail pages  

## Outcomes
- Google Maps successfully integrated into the application  
- Monument locations displayed as interactive map markers  
- Enhanced user navigation and spatial exploration experience
