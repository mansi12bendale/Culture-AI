# Week 2: Web-to-Android Setup & UI Design

## Objective
Initialize the Web-to-Android project environment and design the user interface for core application screens.

## Summary
In Week 2, the **CultureAI** application was developed using a **Web-to-Android approach**, where web-based UI components were adapted for Android deployment. The focus was on designing core screens such as the splash screen, home screen, and monument detail screen. A card-style layout was created to present monument information, including images and titles. Static data was integrated to validate the UI layout and navigation flow during the initial prototype phase.

## Key Activities

- Implemented card-based layout for monument display  
- Integrated static data for prototype UI testing  

## Outcomes
