# Week 5: Firebase Integration & User Feedback

## 🎯 Objective
Implement Firebase for real-time data management and user-generated reviews.

## 📘 Summary
Firebase was integrated for real-time data management and user feedback collection. We set up Firestore to store user reviews and ratings for monuments, creating a system where users can share their experiences and rate monuments. The reviews are displayed on the monument detail pages, providing valuable user-generated content.

## 📌 Key Activities

- Created a UI for submitting reviews and ratings.
- Implemented logic to fetch and display reviews under each monument’s details.

## ✅ Outcomes
